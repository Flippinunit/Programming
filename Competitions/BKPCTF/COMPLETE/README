#Monty Hall wrote a script of how he was supposed to run one of his game 
#shows for his trusty accounting computer some time ago, but hes not really 
#sure what the punch cards mean any more. I mean, that was a while ago. Only, 
#hes sure his key is hidden somewhere in these punch-cards, if he could figure 
#out how to run them...
